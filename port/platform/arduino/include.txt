# This file should contain the paths to all header files that are
# required for ubxlib on the Arduino platform.  Do not include
# test or example directories.
# Paths are relative to the ubxlib root directory, forward-slashes
# must be used.
# Header files are included in the order listed.
# Generally only directories are listed here.  However, if it
# is required that a header file appears higher in the include
# order (e.g. if it includes a type which other header files
# depend on) then its full path can be explicitly included
# in the appropriate position in the list.
