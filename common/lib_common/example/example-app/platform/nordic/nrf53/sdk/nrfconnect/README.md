# libfibonacci application example for nrf53

This is an application showing some simple use of the ubxlib library example, `libfibonacci`.

It is specific for nrf53 using nrf-connect.

To build:
```
$ west build -p auto -b nrf5340pdk_nrf5340_cpuapp <UBXLIB>/common/lib_common/example/example-app/platform/nordic/nrf53/sdk/nrfconnect
```

This application includes the library as a data array as generated by the library make script.

During building, the libfibonacci make script will produce a `libfibonacci/` folder under zephyrs `build/` folder. In here, there is an artefact named `libfibonacci_blob.c`. This file contains an array being the actual library blob. The file is added to the application in the utility cmake script `common/lib-example/platform/nordic/nrf53/sdk/nrfconnect/libfibonacci.cmake`
