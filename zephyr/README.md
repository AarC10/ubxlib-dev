# Why This Directory Is Here
This directory is added to permit Zephyr users to include `ubxlib` as a [Zephyr module](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/modules.html); that is all it does, nothing else.

Please look in the [port/platform/zephyr](/port/platform/zephyr) directory for all the actual Zephyr platform support stuff.
